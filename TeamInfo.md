## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that enables users to explore historical and academic events dynamically through an interactive timeline. Users can search for any topic of their interest such as “mathematics” or “computer science,” and generate their own customized timeline to showcase the major events of the field. From there, users can additionally refine their query by searching and filtering accordingly. Additionally, the platform allows users to create and personalize their own timelines based on their topics of interest or their personal lives. 

This tool serves as a research or educational aid and can provide knowledge about how specific fields have evolved over time and even how different topics intersect. The system will aggregate various data sources for a well rounded timeline.
