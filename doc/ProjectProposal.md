# Project Proposal-(Project Title)

## Description:

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that enables users to explore historical and academic events dynamically through an interactive timeline. Users can search for any topic of their interest such as “mathematics” or “computer science,” and generate their own customized timeline to showcase the major events of the field. From there, users can additionally refine their query by searching and filtering accordingly. Additionally, the platform allows users to create and personalize their own timelines based on their topics of interest or their personal lives. 

This tool serves as a research or educational aid and can provide knowledge about how specific fields have evolved over time and even how different topics intersect. The system will aggregate various data sources for a well-rounded timeline


## Components:
1. View events: Events are categorized based on topics (e.g., historical, academic, personal). Users can toggle event categories on or off. Users also can expand and view the details of the events by clicking on them.
2. Search & Filter: Users can search for events by keywords and filter timelines based on event categories or timeframes.
3. Create Personal Events: Users can log in and create their events, with tags of different categories. Users can add descriptions and images to their events.
4. An additional idea – Shared Timelines: Users can create personal events on the timeline, connect with friends, and view their combined life events on a single timeline. Users can choose to share the timeline externally.

## Usefulness:

This application will serve users such as researchers, students, and history enthusiasts by offering an intuitive way to explore the evolution of topics overtime. Unlike static historical databases, our application is more dynamic as users can generate topic based timelines on demand. Similar tools may exist, but this offers an aggregation of various sources and is customizable to refine searches to fit the exact user need.  

Additionally, users can add their events, whether it is a topic related to their research or their personal endeavors. Users can also connect with friends on *insert app name* and view everyone's life at a glance.

## Data Sources:

For research paper events: Semantic Scholar API  and PubMed API: Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities). 

## Functionality Description:

1. Create: Users can add new personal events. Each event includes a name, date, description, categories, and image.
2. Read: Users can view and search events based on category or time period.
3. Update: Users can edit or update event details.
4. Delete: Users can remove personal events.
5. Search: Users can filter timelines more advancedly by keyword, category, and time range.

## UI mockup:

The UI mockup showcased the main timeline, with two different categories of events. And the interaction for filtering categories, searching by keywords, searching and adding friends, and adding new events.
