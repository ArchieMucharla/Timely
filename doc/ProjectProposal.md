# Project Proposal-(Project Title)

## Description:


## Components:
1. View events: Events are categorized based on topics (e.g., historical, academic, personal). Users can toggle event categories on or off. Users can filter events based on specific timeframes. Users can expand and view the details of the events.
2. Search & Filter: Users can search for events by keywords. Users can filter timelines based on event categories or timeframes.
3. Create Personal Events: Users can log in and create their events, with tags of different categories. Users can add descriptions and images to their events.
4. An additional idea â€“ Shared Timelines: Users can also create personal events on the timeline, connect with friends, and view their combined life events on a single timeline. Users can take a screenshot of the timeline to share externally.
